# Getting started

To get set up for Week 1:

- You should create a github repository to submit your answers to the reading questions and solutions to the numerical exercises. You should make this a private repository and add andrewcumming as a collaborator

- Install the python version of rebound and get the Week 1 starting notebook up and running:
  - Create a folder for your rebound projects
  - Set up a virtual environment with `python -m venv rebound-venv` and activate it with `source rebound-venv/bin/activate`
  - Then `pip install rebound jupyter numpy matplotlib ipywidgets ipympl`
  - Try running the notebook and make sure it works. You should see an animation of a 2-body orbit.
